I played through the Twine game named “A Tale of Crowns” and found this game to be really interesting. In terms of a traditional game, I think that the storyline is very similar to any other gaming type that we have today. There is a plot with a mission and you, the player, get to decide the outcome based on your choices. I will say that it did seem very much so like a short story, rather than a game. With a game I expect there to be more graphics as well as possibly mini games that you would partake in that would go in hand with the plot. This game format seemed to be strictly geared towards those who don’t mind reading. As a journalism major with English as one of my minors, this format was enjoyable for me to partake in, though for me personally, it is hard to say that this is a game format. This type of game is not one that I would suggest to my diehard gamer friends. But that is why this format exists. All types and variations of games exist to meet the needs of specific users. This game format just seems to be very specific and relies on the player to use their own sources of imagery to fully play the story out. To me it felt as though I was able to tell a book how I wanted it to end instead of having to read with no control and deal with the outcome.
Overall I enjoyed getting to experience this type of game format!
