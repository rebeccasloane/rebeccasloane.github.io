The chance-based activity has thrown me for a loop.
I am not exactly sure that I am understanding how to process it correctly and therefore, what I was trying to achieve did not happen.
I really wanted to make a chance short story to test out my skills and the ability to play the story multiple times.
I wanted to test this out because I thought it could be fun to incorporate this into my final project.
I am considering doing a story where the reader would choose their outcome.
The catch is that I would want the story to be relayed by different videos.
At the end of the video, there would be a question or a choice which would then lead to another video.
I am not sure if a repository would be the best place to try and proces this or if I can figure out a way to do it on one of the programs we learned abput for short stories.
My best reasoning for tying in video and possibly photo footage is because not all readers will want to actually read. 
For me, having multimedia tied into this project can really appeal to a different, and possibly younger, audience.
Will definitely have to think on this and how I might go about producing it.
Wish me luck!
