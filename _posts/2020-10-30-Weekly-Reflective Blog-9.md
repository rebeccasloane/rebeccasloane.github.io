After taking the time to read over the audience lesson I have decided to take a few things into consideration. Mainly...

  <h2>What audience do I fit in with?</h2>
  
Isn't it such a weird feeling to try to look at yourself as a third person? 
It most definitely is for me. 
But it is what I needed to do!
If you are not producing something that YOU are interested in then what are you doing?

Maybe I should go into inspirational blogs.....hah! Bet-a nah (imagine that in a British accent!)

Anyways, I am for some reason I am very into fashion, yet I am horrible at portraying it. 
I love the way boutiques show their products and also how it is styled.
I think that I would like the opportunity to be able to have a website where I can blog my looks but also have a page where the viewer may be able to choose certain items of clothing to create an item.
This would be expressed by all outfit combinations being an outcome for the viewer to choose. 
In some ways I am very excited to nail down the concept and what kind of media will be required, and the other part of me is very scared about the turnout.
Excited to work on my proposal and try to explain all of the ideas in my head.
