Personally, at my current job I have been working this past week and the biggest word that kept popping up was hypertext. Now hypertext, I realized as I was going through the motions of researching for my job, is information that is embedded into data that already exists. This way there is not an overbearing amount of information and data on a page.
I did start on this week's assignments later than usual, but once I saw that we were dealing with hypertext I was excited to see what areas we were actually looking at. I actually did not realize that HTML stood for hypertext markup language. I know that it was spoken about earlier this year in the semester but I had completely forgotten that that was literally a portion of what HTML meant. 
The concept of Hypertext makes sense, but learning that it was thought of early on is very interesting to think about. I forget that it was just in the 60s that we sent a man to the moon and we had computers. I know call me forgetful, But reading back over the fact that hypertext was in early concepts from around 1945 and has continuously grown and become an actual thing, in other words, the technology has caught up, it is interesting to see how hypertext has been used for such things as wiki rabbit holes and hypertext games.
When I started to read that there were hypertext games, I got really excited because the only other time I have talked about gay making was in my new media and industry voice course. And that class, however, those games were about us creating them not necessarily using hypertext formats, it is still interesting to see and already have an understanding on the online game world as a whole.
The game that I chose to do, “ A Tale of Crowns,” was definitely a different style of game than I was expecting. When I think about an online game, I definitely still think about there being different graphics or maybe there’s different mini games that need to be played in order to earn position in order to advance, but as I said it was interesting to see a game be played out by just text and then responses that you get to choose between. This game format is definitely not one that I think I would recommend to my diehard gamer friends, and this is mainly because the kinds of games that they play has a very end of story and plot just like this, but they get to go and explore throughout an actual place rather than having to imagine an entire universe themselves. I think that for those of us who like to read and are really good at English or whatever language the game is presenting, then these types of games are perfectly fine for us to use, but they’re definitely not for everybody and not what you typically expect when you say the term online game.
Nonetheless, I do find this concept intriguing and in my head think to myself, “Oh I can do this too.” This is not necessarily what I was thinking about for my final project but it is an interesting concept to be introduced to us in this class and forces us to keep our minds open about the possibilities of what we can produce for our final project.
